# Sliding Window
* "A computational technique to reduce a nested loop to a single loop" by changing the window we're looking at (typically one at a time)

# Clues
* Problem involves an array, list, or string type data of data structure
* Asks to find a subrage in the list or string that gives the longest, shortest, or target values

# How-to
1. Find the size of the window required.
2. Compute the result for the 1st window.
3. Use a for-loop to slide the window by 1.
4. Continue until you reach the end.
