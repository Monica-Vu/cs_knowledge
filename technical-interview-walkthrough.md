# Ask Questions & Clarify Requirements 
* What is the input data am I provided? (type and format)
* What output data expected? (type and format). Clarify if you need to return the exact data structure OR if the information itself is returned. 
* What are the minimum and maximum values for the input data?
* Is the input always valid? If not, what are the edge cases?
* Generate some test cases and the expected output if possible. Expand beyond the given examples. 
* Will I need to (or would it be helpful) to transform my data?
    * Sometimes, sorted elements in a list can be helpful 
    * If you need to consistently get a value, maybe changing it to a dictionary
* Are there any crucial information I need to know? 

# Before Starting The Question
* Ask the interviewer if they're familiar with the programming language syntax
    * If they're not, do your best to explain as you go

TODO...summarize the following:
ASK QUESTIONS:
- What data am I provided? (type, format); what are the minimum and maximum values of this data? 
- What is the simplest case? The most complicated?
- What is the expected output (type, format) â€” clarify if you just need the data. Is this the expected data structure or is that information sufficient?
- Do I need to transform my data before computing? ex/ For Strings
- Does this problem remind me of other problem and can I draw inspiration from it? 
- What are some of the tools I provided (or am limited to)? 
- Is the input always valid? Edge cases? If the example was unclear, go through it again

BEFORE:
- Ask engineer if they're familiar with language syntax 
- Mention why you might be doing certain parts  

BRAINSTORM: think out loud and plan a solution via pseudocode 
- Re-read the question out loud
- Go through each example that is provided
- Try to come up with other examples (think edge cases) 
- Make notes or diagrams in comments
- Try to express in a concise, verbal manner
- When appropriate, use technical terms ex/ memoization, names of algorithmic techniques, pass by reference/value

COMPLETE YOUR SOLUTION: 
- Ideally the easiest part, but make sure you know your language pretty well

DEVELOP: 
- Test and optimize your solution (if possible)
- State the current time complexity and space complexity
- Go through some edge cases 
- Talk about improvements (at the minimum)
