# About
Object-oriented programming uses the concepts of class by combining a group of data into attributes and methods, typically represent a class. This allows multiple independent objects to be instatiated or represented from the same class and interact with each other in complex ways.

By defining a set of classes that represent and encapsulate objects in a program, these classes can be organized into modules; this would improve the structure and organization of software programs.

# Basic Concepts 
## Encapsulation 
* Hide class' private details by binding data and functions into a single unit class 
* A class is well-capsulated when details about functionality to the interface is shown and does not allow code access to its private data 

### Analogies / Examples
* Set private variables and functions 
* Hide details about your SIN or bank information 

## Abstraction 
* It's easier to reason and design a program when you can seperate the interface from implementation
* To do so, treat system as a "black box": you pass in the required parameters and it outputs what you expect 
* Only present the easy-to-use interface via class' member function 

### Advantages 
* Isolate impacts made to code: implementation changes are only affected 

### Analogies
* You don't need to know how a car works to drive it
* You don't need to constantly think about breathing or digesting

## Inheritance 
* "IS-A" relationship between two classes
* The child/subclass gets some attributes or functions from the parent class and can have additional ones as well

### Examples 
* A child inherits attributes from their parents
* Insects and reptiles share a Animal class

### Advantages 
* Isolate impacts made to code: implementation changes are only affected
